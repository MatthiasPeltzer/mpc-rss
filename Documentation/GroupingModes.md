```

### When to Override

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Same grouping everywhere | Site Settings only |
| Different per page | Override in plugin |
| A/B testing | Different plugins, different modes |

## Implementation Notes

### Category Mode (Current Default)
- Uses RSS `<category>` tags
- Falls back to URL-based category detection
- Falls back to source name
- Finally "Allgemein" / "General"

### Source Mode (Proposed)
- Groups by `sourceName` field
- Always consistent
- Simplest implementation
- **Recommended as new default**

### Date Mode
- Groups items by date ranges
- Options: Today, Yesterday, This Week, This Month
- Within each range: sorted by time

### None Mode
- No grouping at all
- Pure array sorted by date descending
- Simplest template
- Best performance

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Add Field (Current)
- Add `tx_mpcrss_grouping_mode` field
- Keep "category" as default
- No breaking changes

### Phase 2: Recommended Change
- Change default to "source" in next major version
- Provide migration notice
- More predictable behavior

### Phase 3: Template Optimization
- Create separate templates per mode
- Optimize for each use case
- Better performance

## Future Enhancements

### Possible additions:
1. **Custom Grouping** - User-defined groups
2. **Multi-level** - Group by source, then category
3. **Tag Cloud** - Visual category browsing
4. **AI Categories** - ML-based topic detection
5. **Saved Views** - User preferences per plugin

## Conclusion

**For most users, we recommend "Group by Source"** because:
- ‚úÖ Always consistent
- ‚úÖ Clear attribution
- ‚úÖ No fallback complexity
- ‚úÖ Predictable behavior
- ‚úÖ Source credibility matters

The current "Category" default works but requires good RSS category tags. Consider changing the default to "source" in the next major version for better out-of-the-box experience.
